# GX data layout and media formats

The playable package is:

```text
Shaiya GX/
  Shaiya GX          # Linux; Shaiya GX.exe on Windows
  data/
    interface/       # PNG only, including icons, portraits and minimaps
    Sound/           # Ogg Vorbis, including Music/
    Character/
    World/
    ...
```

The executable discovers `data/` beside itself regardless of the current working directory. `-data` / `SHAIYA_DATA` can explicitly select a different data directory for development. No SAH/SAF index, font folder, launcher, Python or external media codec is needed to run the game. Both fonts are embedded. Platform graphics/audio libraries and drivers are still required.

GX indexes loose file paths once at startup and preserves the old case-insensitive resource lookup on Linux and Windows. Restart after editing assets to refresh that index and the CPU/GPU caches. Symlinks and ambiguous case/hash names are rejected, so the folder remains portable. A legacy invalid-byte filename is escaped as `%XX`; lookup applies the same mapping to binary references without changing model data.

## Import original data

The original SAH is a directory/index and SAF contains file payloads. The importer follows the Parsec-compatible reader in `internal/data/archive`; it does not modify the source archives.

With FFmpeg/libvorbis, optipng, the client build dependencies and a working OpenGL context, run from the GX checkout:

```sh
go run ./cmd/datamigrate \
  -source /path/to/original-archives \
  -output /path/to/staging/data \
  -report /path/to/private/conversion.json
```

The output must be a new directory. The JSON report stays outside the playable data and records source/output paths, hashes, sizes, conversions and reference updates. `-resume` reuses verified successful results only when both original archive hashes and quality match the report. Keep source archives outside the playable folder for reference/re-import. Never commit those archives, the loose game data or the private conversion report.

Stage and verify the new directory and executable together before replacing an installation. Original clients cannot use this GX-specific layout without their own loader/media changes.

## Interface PNG

Every image under `interface/` is converted from its actual decoded content, including files whose old extension did not match their header. TGA, DDS, JPEG and BMP become real PNG files; this is not an extension-only rename. Conversion is lossless relative to the existing decoded pixels, including dimensions, alpha and RGB under fully transparent pixels. PNG uses best-compression deflate and lossless optipng optimization; no palette quantization or resizing is applied.

Some original TGA and DDS atlases share a stem while containing different artwork or layouts. DDS-origin files therefore use `_dds.png`, e.g. `icon/01_dds.png`, while the TGA counterpart becomes `icon/01.png`. Runtime references use these explicit PNG names.

For compressed DDS, the importer reads back the same GPU-decoded pixels as the existing renderer. Authored mip levels are preserved as additional lossless PNG images in an optional private ancillary `gxMP` chunk. Standard PNG viewers display the base image normally; GX restores all authored levels and their original sampling behavior. Editing the base image requires regenerating or dropping its old mip chunk to avoid stale levels. Textures for 3D characters, world geometry and effects retain their original formats and GPU compression.

## Ogg Vorbis audio

All WAV resources become `.ogg` using libvorbis VBR quality 6, 44100 Hz, retaining mono or stereo where applicable. Vorbis is lossy; this quality setting targets a substantial disk reduction while preserving high audio quality. Original sound durations are checked against the converted decoded PCM, and every result is decoded by GX's actual Go decoder before acceptance.

Audio references in structured MON/WLD and similar resources are retargeted from `.wav` to `.ogg` using equal-length substitutions, preserving record lengths and offsets. Hardcoded recipes, UI sounds, login music and tests also request OGG. Game audio decodes only Ogg Vorbis, without FFmpeg or codec DLLs at runtime; the bounded decoder normalizes supported mono/stereo streams to the existing 44100 Hz stereo PCM mixer. The old WAV decoder remains an import/verification utility.

This changes resource storage and loading, not server rules, packet formats, combat timing or database contents.


## Cursors and skill data

`Cursor/01.png` through `07.png` contain the native cursor artwork. Conversion preserves every decoded RGBA pixel and each cursor's dimensions; all seven original hotspots are `(0,0)`, used directly by the client. CUR is retained only as an import/test decoder.

The active skill catalog is `Character/Skill.SData`, encoded as EP5 (nine record slots per group). The author's replacement `Skill4.SData` was identified by Parsec as EP6, despite its filename; EP4 and EP5 readers reject that input. Parsec converted its 326 groups to EP5, retaining the first nine slots and group ordering. No active skills occupied slots 10–15. EP5 serialization was read back and verified byte-for-byte, with names, descriptions, icons and levels checked. The source and previous active catalog remain in private backups outside playable data; only the correctly named converted catalog is installed. This client catalog replacement does not migrate server skill definitions.
